## Matthew
I believe good communication at the very least is important in a team so everyone knows what is happening at any given time. In addition if the team is comfortable with good amounts of communication, hopefully it means everyone is comfortable enough to let the team know of any issues that arise, or need help with so the team can get issues done together quickly if needed.
