## Matthew
I believe good communication at the very least is important in a team so everyone knows what is happening at any given time. In addition if the team is comfortable with good amounts of communication, hopefully it means everyone is comfortable enough to let the team know of any issues that arise, or need help with so the team can get issues done together quickly if needed.

## Crisostomo
I believe open communication and respect are the key ingredients to a great team dynamic. The ability to communicate our limitations and ask for help without fear of repercussions allows a much healthier environment that reduces the chances of a team falling apart and becoming dysfunctional.
