## Matthew
I feel a team should at the very least have a very good amount of communication so everyone on the team knows what is going on at any given time. And if there is good communication, hopefully everyone on the team is also comfortable enough so if any mistakes are made, it doesn't feel like that person will be looked down upon and we can get issues resolved right away.
