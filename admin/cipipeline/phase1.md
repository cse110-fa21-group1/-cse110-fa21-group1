As of the second checkpoint, we have completed the entirety of our CI/CD pipeline. When we first began this portion of the project, we implemented the core Node.js checks such as linting and JSDocs. The linting and code-style enforcement to make sure we were all on the same page and following that we implemented JSDocs so that our source files would be annotated properly. Afterwards, for our second checkpoint, we added code review through codefactor that would check for any issues within our code. Additionally, we sucessfully deployed all of our code through netlify. As shown below, this is the process of our current pipeline:

As of the second checkpoint, we have completed our CI/CD pipeline and everything within our repository is functional. For the rest of the quarter, we will use the pipeline to its full extent, especially now as we are currently focusing on testing and fixing any bugs that appear in our recipe manager application.
