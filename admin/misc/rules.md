## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
Slack will be the primary source of communication, discord would also be nice as well. Please be active and communicate with your fellow teammates and hold weekly meetings and attend them as much as possible.


## Scheduling meetings
Scheduled meetings will occur on zoom and we plan on having static meeting times once a week.
## General Responsibilities for all team members
All team members must communicate with one another, learning technologies and languages that are required for this class (increase bus factor!), attend standup meetings when possible and organized by the team leaders. 

## Conflict Resolution
Anonymous feedback forms must be filled out during every weekly meeting, fill out google meetings. If there as an issue that needs to be resolved by a higher up.

## Expectation of fellow team members
Please be civil to each other, talk often, and be mindful of other people's responsibilities. Please try and dedicate around 4 hours a week to developing so we can stay up to date with each other. Be willing to ask for help if you have an issue.
