## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
Slack will be the primary source of communication, discord would also be nice as well. Please be active and communicate with your fellow teammates and hold weekly meetings and attend them as much as possible.

## Scheduling meetings
Scheduled meetings will occur on zoom and we plan on having static meeting times once a week.

## General Responsibilities for all team members
All team members must communicate with one another, learn technologies and languages that are required for this class (increase bus factor!), attend standup meetings when possible and organized by the team leaders. 

## Conflict Resolution
If there's ever an issue, please try and resolve it amongst yourselves civilly, if the discussion cannot continue, contact the team leaders and ask them for help and an opinion. If the matter is too grave or too difficult to resolve, we will then ask the TA's for help and work our way up the chain until we get an opinion from Powell. If you have a private matter with someone else and would like to be anonymous, feel free to message the team leaders and the TA so that the issue could be handled behind the scenes.

## Expectation of fellow team members
Please be civil to each other, talk often, and be mindful of other people's responsibilities. Please try and dedicate around 4 hours a week to developing so we can stay up to date with each other. Be willing to ask for help if you have an issue.
