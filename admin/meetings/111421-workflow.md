# Agenda
## Updates from Last Week's Meeting
Discussion: CI/CD Pipeline Progress
Conclusion: Hit the first checkpoint, but still have to get the testing (integrating Jest, etc) into github. 
Action: Aiming to get it done by tonight by Navya and Darwin.

## Assigning Story Points
Discussion: Create a format for how to decide creating issues. Can be selective or crude. Write in brackets if back-end or front-end, label, add time.\
Conclusion: It should be simple enough and make sure to follow through on keeping it one consistent style.\
Action: Navya trying to finish by tonight.

## Backend Team Status and Integration
Discussion: ADR Assignment. We might need to do more research by spoonacular. Can we get some back-end integrated by tomorrow's discussion? \
Conclusion: Made decision to use spoonacular, repo done, waiting on commit (ADR). Integration unlikely (only had a day).  
Action: Will present pipeline and html on Monday's discussion and demonstrate our progress in back-end. 

## Potentially Shifting Front-End to Back-End
Discussion: If anyone in the back-end team is struggling, please let leaders know. Checked status of front-end team, on-track and pretty much good to go.\
Conclusion: Will look to move those done with front-end to help out.\
Action: Will work together to finish crud prototype by next week, no exceptions.

## Plan for Finishing API Exploration and Implementation
Discussion: Spoonacular Recipes, can upload your own recipes. Not sure how long it will take though.\
Conclusion: This week will be back-end week. \
Action: Will hold another back-end meeting to smooth this decision out.

## Deadlines
Discussion: ADR, Retrospective, Sprint Review, and Team status video "due" on the 22nd. Prototype by Friday. No exceptions.\
Conclusion: For this video, let's do it after Thursday lecture after the standup meeting.\
Action: Retro and Sprint today.

# Additional Notes/Info:
- More Interim Meetings? Could do standup at the same time. Wed for an extra interim meeting.
- Change meeting time with Sanat? Beneficial to have as many people as possible.

# For next time:
- Plan for the second sprint.
