## What we should implement
- Shadow root: still have minor issue, will be fixed after this meeting very soon.
- Frontend team is currently working on differnet page, should the frontend team work on a same feature at the same time? - There is a standard style for frontend so it should not be a problem.
- Frontend work remains: can be done before discussion.
- New feature: Pin, calendar and timer page.
- Timer: Frontend team need to decide where the timer go and start implementation.
- Calendar: Maybe we can just import google calendar. The implementaion may be hard for calendar page.
- New page: Ingredient of a week. Choose ingredients on a daily basis. Show the user recipes based on that ingredient. This feature should be implemented on a different page.
