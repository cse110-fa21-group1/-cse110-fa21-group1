# Agile Retrospective Sprint 1
### Ratings:
Our team was asked to rate our group on the following aspects on a scale of 1 to 5 with a following explanation: \
Clarity, Autonomy, Engagement, Communication, Mastery
- John: Clarity: 3 (I'm still not fully clear about some aspects of our final design [Are we having a page to see your archive of saved recipes?])
Autonomy: 4 (I've  been able to work on our stuff for the most part. Waiting on merges is a bit slow though)
Engagement: 5 (I think I've done a lot this week, finished it on time)
Communication: 3 (There isn't that much communication between the front-end and back-end, but we can see what's happening)
Mastery: 3 (Still trying to figure out how APIs work and implementation with HTML)
- Darwin: Clarity: 4  didn't know what some API's were,Autonomy:3 hard to work on my own sometimes, Engagement: 5, always working and doing something, Communication: 3, the communication between backend-frontend is somethings were missing Mastery: 4, Got most of the things down, just a couple of things need to work on here and there
- Mike: Clarity: 4 ( From meetings and announcement from the TA I feel like I know what should I need to do now, and ours team leads did a good job)
Autonomy: 4 (mostly fine, I got some stuff done last week and mostly free)
Engagement: 4 ( I do got from meetings with professors and research, also the team leads are effective on making sure everyone is on the same page)
Communication: 3.5, I do check messages on slack regularly but I have not use a lot public messages)
Mastery: 3 (I  still need to figure out something’s about the API)

- Chrisostomo: Clarity: 5, For the most part fine, no issues here, everything is clear, Sanat meetings help!
Autonomy: 5, Haven't been tied down to anything, can work at own pace
Engagement: 4.3, Busy constantly which is good and got a lot of stuff done!
Communication: 4.3, Meetings with Sanat help a lot regarding what's going on!
Mastery: 4.3, Basically know everything that needs to be done on my part, just need to learn a couple things regarding buttons.
- Jennifer: Clarity: 4
Usually I'm just working on assignments and stuff that Sanat tells us to do, so things are pretty clear. I do get a bit confused at times though because the terms used in this class are different from those used in classes. AKA Fat marker design vs wireframes vs paper prototypes.
Autonomy: 4
Tasks are delegated during weekly meetings, so autonomy is pretty good. Things that require multiple people are usually done during meetings.
Engagement: 2
Animal Crossing has consumed my life and now I have time for nothing else. Oops.
Communication: 3
Outside of our weekly meetings, and it can be a bit difficult to understand what to do. I usually have no idea what other people are up to.
Mastery: 3
Haven't really gotten into the deep end of coding and such, so I can't really tell for this one.
- Matthew: Clarity: 3.8 It’s pretty clear about where things are going with the project, just kinda clueless what backend is though since I haven’t had time to look at it
Autonomy: 4 been able to work on what I need to do on my own time (busy with other classes) and can get nearly done 
Engagement: 3.4 Can get stuff done, with others etc like with Jennifer on the sigma, but sometimes feels like I haven’t been able to do much because of other things that get in my way, like the lab for this class. 
Communication: 3.5 there’s good communication but could use more communication between front and back end, or I just need to lurk back-end channel more. 
Mastery: 3 I know what I need to do, sometimes I don’t know how to go about it
- Zimo: Clarity: 4.2 (In general pretty clear, we know what is happening next and what is expected, a little confused in api aspects)
Autonomy: 3.8 (Working with HWs/quizzes)
Engagement: 3.5 (Feel like I can and should do more besides spending time in video searching)
communication: 3.5 (Didn't share or talk about the progress/ideas much, mostly individual work so far)
Mastery: 3.5 (Still rusty regarding spoonacular in general)

### Project  as a whole
Next we asked our team how they feel regarding the entire project (on a scale of 1-5 once more). What are they glad about, what are they dissapointed about?:
- John: 4 I'm pretty happy with where we are right now. It looks like our front-end team has finished with the structure of all of our pages, and it does look like the back-end team is ready to go for implementing it all. The design team's work is also looking rather nice. We have a nice roadmap and are sticking to it well. I'm getting the feeling that we're one of the slower teams but honestly, we look on track to finishing it all, which is what matters ultimately, so I'm satisfied with our project progress.
- Darwin: 3.9, Still kinda slow because I'm on the backend day and I haven't done much yet, bit of a slower team since not a lot has been day, we have a good schedule, but we gotta get started with the backend as soon as possible, but I'm around 80% sure we can hit the deadline friday.
- Mike: I would say a 4 since we know what we need to do and we are able to spend time working on ,there are some issues with masteries and communications. It is understandable since we are not use to a lot of things but we can definitely learn it. We probably do need some more communications outside of the meetings. But I believes we can still hit the deadline and get things done.
- Chrisostomo: 4, hearing about the deadline stuff makes me a bit nervous, but regarding the extended deadlines I'm confident we'll be able to finish everything, the design + frontend stuff is coming along well, as long as the backend can get stuff started and going I think we'll be okay. 
- Jennifer: Overall: 3.5?
Since our meetings are on Sunday, I feel like we get behind on things or do things last minute. Frontend seems to be doing some progress, and backend is doing research too.
- Matthew: 4.0, project seems to be going well and people are making a lot of progress, even if it’s the backend reading up how to do things (which is expected) so I am confident that we can get things done, regardless of Sanat saying we’re a little behind, however like with the quirks mentioned before, there are some things we could work on as a team, mainly communication I suppose. Overall things are looking good.
- Zimo: 4
I'm happy with the flow of the project, clear targeted and the meetings checks on the progress. Frontend team finished a lot of work. Looking forward to implementing the backend features, little worried about how much time it may take. Thank you Dominik and Navya for organizing and leading the group.

### Additional Comments
Afterwards, we collected general comments and additional statements, what can be improved?: In general, it seems we might need to up communication between the frontend and backend teams. As a result we have created a couple more meetings to address this issue so that we can complete the CRUD prototype by the end of the week. Otherwise it seems like everything is working well.
