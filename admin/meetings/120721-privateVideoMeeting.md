## What we did
- Set up
  We made a presentation which we go over in our meeting explaining what we did throughout the quarter.

- Challenges Overcomed
  - Throughout the project, we were able to plan our work in a balanced manner, resulting in everyone doing work constantly at some point
  - Admittedly, our communication was not as good as we expected, but as the quarter progressed and as Sanat pointed out our flaws we were able to pick up the pace
  - At the start of the project, we felt like we were a bit off-course and we were a bit confused, but as the sprints began, we were able to get on the right track 
  - Meetings at the start were generally 1 dimensional, but as the quarter progressed the meetings had more depth in that we were able to discuss the project and its intricacies
  - Generally flexible, although finals and Thanksgiving did pose some problems workload and meeting wise.
  - Team members were willing to work with each other and asked for help often.

- Things for future CSE110 students
  - Start early!
  - Get to know your teammates! Build rapport!
  - Plan and test often! Not just at the beginning or the end of the project, things can change quickly!
  - COMMUNICATE!
  - Complete every lab and explore all the details to their fullest extent! They help immensely!
  - Never be afraid to ask questions! It helps everyone in the long run, better to ask questions than be stuck for hours on a problem
  - ***Have fun!*** There arenâ€™t many classes that provide valuable experiences like this one!
