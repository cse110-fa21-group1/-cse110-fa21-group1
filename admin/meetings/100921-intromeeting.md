# Additional Notes/Info
Team leads must be the primary communication between the TA and the team. There might be other logistical work as well such as conducting meetings, managing other people, etc. The team leads can overstep their boundaries and become developers, testers, etc if they so wish. \
Discussed the various potential roles that a team could consist of, i.e Team leads, designer, planner, developers, testers, builders, etc. (NOTE: The slide shown in discussion is just a guideline, we could be as flexible as we like) \
Github actions is a useful tool for testing! We are the ones responsible for testing before we turn in the project or an assignment.
# For next time:
We must set up another meeting to address all other assignments (check slack for more info). Assign another note taker (will probably be Dominik again considering this first meeting didn't really consist of much content).
