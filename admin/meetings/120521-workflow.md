## Bugs we went over/Plans for this week
The text should be worked on within the explore page, not visible!

Navbar bug, when pulling up navbar, when scrolling down it doesn't function properly and looks weird, fix asap! Might want to change the navbar to a pop up menu.

When we heart something on the explore page, it doesn't show up on the recipe page properly (recipe shows up twice?), John/Darwin currently working on that. Pin feature works though.

## Look for bugs!
During our meeting we took several minutes to find bugs within our application, just to make sure everything was working properly, here's what we found:
- When you press 'More Random Recipes' or 'Next' the header text shows 'Showing results from SEARCH TERMS' for a split second before the proper text (looks a bit off)
- When a recipe doesn't have an image the size is different from the rest, which also looks a bit strange
- Recipes are being twice when you add them initially
- Need to fix text styling for explore page, currently black
- Within the recipe, link in the description does not work
- Heart button on the recipe page is unused
- Would like to show 12 recipes instead of 10 to make it look nicer
- Need to show heart recipes from spoonacular, hearted recipes should show up in your personal local machine
- Explore page should not have edit and delete, just add
## Automated Testing
Considering a lot of teams haven't done automated testing, the TA's will be a bit lenient grading wise on this. If we can't do this, we can just do manual testing, but we must document everything that was manually tested, see the google doc (submitted under testing folder in source):

### Current testing status updates
Zimo currently debugging test file, Matthew has completed testing, Mike adding some more tests for search, almost done with storage, Tianze will do some unit testing and might do some manual testing as well
