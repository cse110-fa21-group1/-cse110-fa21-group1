# Agile Sprint Review Meeting 2
In this meeting, we review work accomplished within the last 10 days in great detail
### Tasks completed by each member
- John: Monday: Finished all of the styling (transitions, color, glow) for the Manage Recipe page. 
Tuesday-Friday: Deadlines for other classes
Saturday: Researched on ways to implement the timer. Created design for it on Figma and figured out how to implement the styling and backend for it.
Finish timer w/ Matt Sunday.
- Darwin: On the first half of the week, I was more focused on the pin function implementation for the locastorage and a bit on its application. I was also fixing some frontend and backend bugs. For the second half of the week, I was more on fixing bugs, and more on the light side. Haven’t work on much on the second half of the week but going to work on more this week.
- Tianze: 11.18 Review meeting notes and codes in git repo. Catch up with the project.
11.19 Work on delete recipe function and navigation bar’s backend function.
11.21 Attend general meeting. Did some research on how to make project documentation.
11.24 Meeting with Zimo to discuss how to implement pin function. Attended standup meeting.
- Matthew: On Monday I did most of the styling in terms of adding color and some icons for the Recipe.html page (still some bugs to work out), fasts forward to Saturday/Sunday, I worked on a very buggy/rough implementation of a user settable countdown timer (as seen today)
- Jennifer: On Monday, I finished up the styling for the homepage. From Tuesday onwards, I was with family and didn't work on anything. I did attend the meetings on Saturday and Sunday though.
- Zimo: For the past 3 days and starting from Wednesday was implementing the pin feature, I debugged the feature for a while and I believe it works properly, was gone for most of Thanksgiving
- Crisostomo:
- Mike: The week before thanksgiving I was focusing on the CRUD part for the project and mostly on the return to recipe button and the edit feature. That is around Wednesday to Friday. Then I was focusing on the timer function last week and waiting for a template for the timer.
